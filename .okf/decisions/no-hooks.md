# Context

Automatic upkeep is valuable, but always-on hooks that observe arbitrary sessions
are intrusive and fail third-party marketplace safety review.

# Decision

Ship **zero hooks**. Adoption is opt-in: paste `templates/CLAUDE-okf.md` into a
project's `CLAUDE.md` to have Claude consult `.okf/` before tasks and write
knowledge back after changes (the [okf skill](/skills/okf.md)'s maintain mode).

# Consequences

* No surprise behaviour; trivially passes marketplace safety gates.
* Upkeep depends on the snippet being present — documented in the README.

Superseded by [dormant hooks — opt-in enforced upkeep](/decisions/dormant-hooks.md):
a `Stop` hook now ships with the plugin, but stays a no-op unless a bundle
opts in with `upkeep: enforced`.
