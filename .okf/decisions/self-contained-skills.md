# Context

The [dual-distribution decision](/decisions/dual-distribution.md) means a script's
location differs between the plugin layout and a standalone skills.sh install.

# Decision

Each skill ships its script inside its own directory and invokes it via
`${CLAUDE_SKILL_DIR}`, which the runtime resolves in both layouts. The
[validator](/components/validator.md) and [visualizer](/components/visualizer.md)
are therefore always found alongside their skill.

# Consequences

* The [validate](/skills/validate.md) and [visualize](/skills/visualize.md) skills
  work identically as a plugin or a standalone skill.
* No absolute paths, no post-install configuration.
