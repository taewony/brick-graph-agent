# Context

Releases were a manual `gh release create`, and it showed: versions 0.7.0 and
0.7.1 were bumped in `.claude-plugin/plugin.json` but never tagged or released,
so anyone pinned to a release tag never saw the dormant Stop hook that shipped in
them. A step a human has to remember is a step that eventually gets skipped.

# Decision

A [`release` workflow](/components/release-workflow.md)
(`.github/workflows/release.yml`) runs on every push to `main` that touches
`.claude-plugin/plugin.json`. It reads the version and, if no `okf--v<version>`
release exists yet, creates the tag and a GitHub release with auto-generated
notes. It is idempotent: a version already released is a no-op.

Auto-release only fires *if* the version was bumped, so a `version-bump` CI job
(in `.github/workflows/ci.yml`) makes the bump itself mandatory: a pull request
that touches the shipped surface (`.claude-plugin/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`,
`templates/`, `action.yml`) must raise `plugin.json`'s version, or it fails.
Docs, `.okf/`, tests and CI are exempt; the `skip-version-check` label bypasses
the gate for a shipped change that genuinely warrants no release.

# Consequences

* Bumping the version in `plugin.json` is the single trigger; the release follows
  automatically, so it can no longer be forgotten.
* Notes are auto-generated from merged PRs since the last release; a curated
  title or body can still be edited on the release afterwards.
* The floating `v1` tag that `action.yml` is consumed as
  (`scaccogatto/okf-skills@v1`) is a separate major-version pointer, still moved
  by hand on purpose.
