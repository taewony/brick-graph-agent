# Update Log

## 2026-08-03
* **Enforcement**: Made the version bump mandatory. A `version-bump` CI job fails
  any PR that changes the shipped surface (`.claude-plugin/`, `skills/`, `hooks/`,
  `templates/`, `action.yml`) without raising `plugin.json`'s version; docs/`.okf/`
  /tests are exempt and a `skip-version-check` label bypasses it. This closes the
  gap the [auto-release](/decisions/auto-release.md) trigger left: a release now
  can't be skipped by simply forgetting to bump.
* **Decision**: Automated releases. A [`release` workflow](/components/release-workflow.md)
  now tags and publishes `okf--v<version>` whenever a push to `main` changes
  `plugin.json`'s version — releasing was manual and got skipped (0.7.0 and 0.7.1
  were bumped but never released). Recorded in
  [auto-release](/decisions/auto-release.md); cut the missing v0.7.1 release by
  hand.
* **Removal**: Deleted the whole `benchmark/` tree (the with/without run, its
  reframes, and the unrun cross-session "repetition" protocol). Checked the
  canonical spec (Google `knowledge-catalog`, the vendored `SPEC.md`): OKF's
  stated intent (§1) is portable, diffable, *trustable* knowledge exchange — it
  makes no claim about tokens, cost, or answer quality (those words appear zero
  times). The benchmark measured the ecosystem's adoption pitch, not the
  standard, so it does not belong in the toolkit for the standard. Earlier log
  entries mentioning `benchmark/` are left as history.

## 2026-08-02
* **Fix**: [`okf-stop-check.sh`](/components/stop-hook.md) now counts only
  *modified tracked files*, not any untracked path — it false-fired on the
  first real-world trigger (an untracked `.claude/` worktree dir, in this very
  repo). Ignoring all untracked paths fixes the whole class (`.venv/`,
  `.DS_Store`, build dirs) instead of whitelisting one; a new untracked file
  is not yet a documented asset. Also gitignored `.claude/` here as hygiene.
* **Decision**: Recorded [dormant hooks — opt-in enforced
  upkeep](/decisions/dormant-hooks.md) and shipped the plugin's first hook,
  [`okf-stop-check.sh`](/components/stop-hook.md) on `Stop` — a no-op unless a
  bundle sets `upkeep: enforced` in `.okf/index.md` and the user hasn't set
  `OKF_HOOK=off`. This supersedes [ship no hooks](/decisions/no-hooks.md),
  now `deprecated`.

## 2026-07-29
* **Reframe**: The benchmark docs now lead with what the experiment measured —
  answer quality, +8 points with a consistent why/where pattern — and scope the
  token result to what a one-question-per-session design can see, which excludes
  the cross-session repetition cost a bundle is adopted against. That experiment
  ("What to measure next" in `benchmark/results.md`) is specced and unrun; no
  token claim, favourable or not, until it runs. Prompted by
  [#21](https://github.com/scaccogatto/okf-skills/issues/21).
* **Review**: Re-read the vendored spec's §1 intents against the benchmark
  discourse. The tested claim — better answers, cheaper reading — is the
  ecosystem's adoption pitch; the spec stakes v0.2 on trust of agent-written
  corpora, which a pristine bundle never exercises. Added the trust-calibration
  experiment (seeded rot, flat-notes arm) to `benchmark/results.md`, scoped the
  README's selective-reading row to §8's actual promise, and named the tested
  claim's origin in `benchmark/README.md`.

## 2026-07-27
* **Measurement**: Ran the first benchmark of whether a bundle helps an agent —
  12 fresh agents, this repo with and without `.okf/`, blind grading. Result:
  +8 points of claim coverage, **no token saving** (the bundle arm cost 5% more,
  which at n=1 is noise). The bundle won the *why* questions and lost the
  *where-do-I-change-this* one. Recorded in `benchmark/`, and the README's
  progressive-disclosure claim is now qualified by it.
* **Update**: The [visualizer](/components/visualizer.md) now *derives* the §5.3
  trust tier and staleness instead of printing raw dates — the inference v0.2 is
  named for. Both computed at render time; OKF stores neither on purpose.
* **Update**: The [validator](/components/validator.md) gained the §7 actor check
  (aimed at near-misses of `human:`, the one actor typo that silently changes a
  trust tier), `usage_window`, RFC 3339 instants, and resolution of the
  Attested Computation path-valued fields.
* **Distribution**: Added a composite GitHub Action so a bundle can be gated in
  any repo's CI without Claude Code. CI exercises both its passing and failing
  path — an action that never fails would look green for the wrong reason.
* **Update**: Moved the toolkit to [OKF v0.2](/reference/okf-spec.md) — the
  [validator](/components/validator.md) checks the trust, lifecycle, provenance
  and attestation families, the [visualizer](/components/visualizer.md) renders
  them and draws `sources` edges, and [`okf_init.py`](/components/okf_init.md)
  scaffolds v0.2 frontmatter.
* **Decision**: Recorded [target v0.2, migrate v0.1 rather than tolerate
  it](/decisions/okf-v02-dual-read.md) — the legacy read branches buy warning
  wording, not compatibility, so the upgrade path is `--migrate`, not tolerance.
* **Update**: [`okf_validate.py`](/components/validator.md) gained `--migrate`
  (textual v0.1→v0.2 rewrite, idempotent) and `--max-warnings N` between the
  permissive default and `--strict`.
* **Migration**: This bundle moved to v0.2 — `timestamp` became
  `generated: {by, at}`, `# Citations` became `sources`, every concept gained
  `status`.
* **Build**: `make docs` now pins the exact invocation behind the two GitHub
  Pages demos, and CI fails on a stale `docs/`. They had drifted far enough to
  serve a build predating the DOMPurify sanitize fix — a security fix that
  reached the generator but never the pages it was for.
* **Trim**: Dropped the sample bundle's `Attested Computation` demo and the
  executor/attester it pointed at — a demo of a spec feature the toolkit
  implements nowhere.

## 2026-07-17
* **Update**: Added `okf_init.py` — scaffolds a conformant starter bundle
  (`index.md`, `log.md`, a full-frontmatter starter concept). Documented in
  the [okf skill](/skills/okf.md); CI asserts the scaffold passes
  `okf_validate.py --strict` with zero warnings.

## 2026-07-14
* **Scale guardrails**: the [visualizer](/components/visualizer.md) now defaults
  large bundles to a linear layout, warns past 5k concepts, batches/debounces
  filtering, and gains `--max-nodes` — see the
  [scale guardrails decision](/decisions/scale-guardrails.md).

## 2026-06-28
* **Creation**: Documented okf-skills in its own format — the three
  [skills](/skills/okf.md), the [validator](/components/validator.md) and
  [visualizer](/components/visualizer.md) components, the
  [vendored spec](/reference/okf-spec.md), and the architectural decisions
  ([dual distribution](/decisions/dual-distribution.md),
  [no hooks](/decisions/no-hooks.md),
  [self-contained skills](/decisions/self-contained-skills.md)).
