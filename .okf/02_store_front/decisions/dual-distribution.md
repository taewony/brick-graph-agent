# Context

OKF tooling is only useful where the agent already works. Claude Code users want a
plugin; the broader agent ecosystem (Cursor, Codex, 20+ agents) installs via
skills.sh.

# Decision

One repo, both layouts: `.claude-plugin/` makes it a plugin marketplace;
`skills/<name>/SKILL.md` makes it skills.sh-discoverable. The
[okf](/skills/okf.md), [validate](/skills/validate.md), and
[visualize](/skills/visualize.md) skills are identical in either path.

# Consequences

* Maximum reach from a single source of truth.
* Scripts must resolve their own path in both layouts — see the
  [self-contained-skills decision](/decisions/self-contained-skills.md).
